Just another solution. I had no intention to publish this, I made it just for my own amusement.
I didn't see any solution not using conversion to cartesian coordinates so I decided to share
my solution as it seems to be using a little different angle.

Idea is that when observed from the center of the earth two satellites have a line of sight
if the angle between the satellites is smaller than the sum of the angles of the radio 
horizonts of the satellites.
